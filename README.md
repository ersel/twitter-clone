API is under `/api`
Front-end is under `/front-end`

You need to cd into respective directories and `npm install` dependencies for both.

For the project to work both API and react front-end should be running at the same time.

*To run the API*
1 - `cd /api`
2 - `node index.js`

*To run the front-end*
1 - `cd /front-end`
2 - `npm start` (this might give you a notice about the port, just hit Y on your keyboard.)
